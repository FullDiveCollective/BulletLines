This also works with NPCs that are attacking you. If you are using a controller with analog triggers, you only need to place your finger in one of the triggers and press slightly to see the bullet line activate. For mouse and digital triggers, you need to completely press the button to activate the bullet line. There are some options that you can configure by entering bulletlines in the cheat input field.
